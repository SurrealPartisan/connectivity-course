## My interests
### Related to the field in general
* What brought me to neuroscience was the dream to create brain-computer interfaces or neural implants. I'm still following that dream, but learning the basics has made me also more curious and fascinated by everything related to brains.
* I did my bachelor's degree in engineering physics. That probably describes my approach to the field a lot.
* When it comes to actual work, programming is my main thing.

### Related to this course
* Traditionally, neuroscience has focused on large-scale anatomical level and (sub)cellular level, and that's also where the basics are mainly taught. The most interesting **computational stuff**, however, happens in between, on the **network level**. I hope to learn about that on this course.
* It seems that this course will include some **programmatic tools**. That should be relevant for me.
* **Network theory** is *really cool*.
* Based on one lecture on the *Aivoaakkoset* course a couple of years ago, I think Enrico is a great lecturer. I'm looking forward to learning more from him.
